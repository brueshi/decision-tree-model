Decision trees are a machine learning model used for both regression and classification tasks. A decision tree is a tree-like model where each node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label or a numerical value.

The model works by recursively splitting the data based on the values of the input features until the resulting subsets are homogeneous in terms of the target variable, or a stopping criterion is met. The splitting criterion is chosen based on measures such as information gain, gain ratio, or Gini index, which aim to maximize the homogeneity of the subsets.

Once the tree is trained, it can be used to make predictions for new data points by traversing the tree from the root node to a leaf node based on the values of the input features. The class label or numerical value associated with the leaf node is the prediction.

Decision trees have several advantages, including their interpretability, ability to handle both categorical and numerical data, and robustness to outliers and irrelevant features. They can also be used in ensemble methods such as random forests and gradient boosting to improve their performance.

Decision trees are commonly used in various applications, including credit scoring, medical diagnosis, and fraud detection.
